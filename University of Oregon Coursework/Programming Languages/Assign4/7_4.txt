a) In order for the function to set c = a^2 the function would have
to utilize call by value. If the function uses call by reference than
we would be passing two references to the same object as the first 
two parameters and this would cause aliasing. Thus every time through
the loop the value of x would be decreased and the result would be 
c = a! instead of c = a^a.

b) Again we will have to deassign values a and c and pass them using
call by value to the nested function power(a,a,c) for the same reason
as above. Also as a and c are aliases if we pass them as references
the first thing power will do is set c := 1 which will result in the
program returning 1 every time as the value for reference a will also
return 1.
