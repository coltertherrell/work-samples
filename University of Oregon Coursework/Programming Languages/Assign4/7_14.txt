(a) attached separately

(b) The function will return 1. This is because when the function recurse(n)
is initialized a closure is created that points myop(x,y) declard in line
1. Thus even though we locally create another function called myop(x,y)
after we call recurse(1) the access link points to the first declaration of
myop so in static scope whenever we call recurse(n) we will use the
first declaration of myop().

(c) If it was in dynamic scoping then the value would be 2 as we would
use the second declaration of myop(). This is because when we call
recurse(1) we would follow the control links back up the stack and use the
most recent declaration of myop() on the stack. Thus our diagram would
be changed as we would simply have arrows pointing back up the stack
connecting the control links of the previous activation record on the 
stack.
