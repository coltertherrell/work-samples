pseudocode

val x = ref 0;
fun p(y : int ref) = 
	let
		val x = ref 0
	in
		y := 1
		x := 0
	end;
p(x);

In this function we declare a local reference to x so that we can change
in the scope of the function without changing the value of our original
x. On the other hand, as we are passing a reference to x into the function
as the value y, when we change y we are accessing the same address in
memory and changing the value so the original x reference will reflect the
change.
