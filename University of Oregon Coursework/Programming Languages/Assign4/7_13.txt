(a) 
x = int
f = int -> (int -> int)
h = fn : int -> int

(c)
It will return the value 10. This is because h is a function that takes an
int w and returns w+3+5. This is as when h is initialized it first sets
x = 7 locally and then calls f(3). f(3) returns a funtion that takese an
int w and returns w+x+3. Thus the only problem is to determine x in the
scope of f. As it is statically scoped it uses the closure to point to
the value of x which points to access link 1. Thus it uses the value
of 5 for x even though x was declared as 7 in h's local scope.
